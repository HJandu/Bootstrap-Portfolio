## <ins>About</ins>
In this assignment, I built my portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework from scratch. <br>

My portfolio site includes the following items:

* A navigation bar

* A navigation menu at the top right-hand corner.

* Includes links that are applicable to my portfolio.

* Links that navigate to the appropriate sections.

* A hero section and a jumbotron featuring a picture of my avatar, and my name, along with a short greeting.
  
* A work section which showcases some of my projects.

* A section displaying my work using grids.

* Bootstrap cards used for each project.

* A brief overview of the work.

* A skills section, which lists all the skills I have learned from the bootcamp.
*An about/contact section, which is displayed in the same row.

* A footer section.

* All hyperlinks have a hover effect and all buttons display a box shadow upon hover.


This Bootstrap Portfolio minimizes the use of media queries.
